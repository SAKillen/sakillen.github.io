# Game Critique - Never Stop Sneakin'
Never Stop Sneakin' is a top-down stealth game by Honest Hearts.

The game's controls are extremely simple, with movement being the player's only input. Every other action in the game is dependent on the ifs, wheres, and whens of the player's movement. For this reason, player movement is the first testing priority. It should function identically with different forms of input across the game's various platforms, such as the Nintendo Switch, which accepts either the left analog stick or the touchscreen for input. When walking into an unaware enemy, the player character will automatically attack and kill the enemy. If spotted by the enemy, the appropriate defensive item will automatically be used, if available. Testing will need to be done to ensure that bullets are used on guards, EMP grenades are used on turrets and cameras, and smoke grenades are used when both the former items are exhausted. Keycards dropped from killed enemies need to be tested to ensure that they drop, point the way to their relevant terminal, and unlock their terminal upon interaction. Levels are procedurally generated, and need to be tested to make sure that no two runs are the same. Lastly, loadouts, which are purely cosmetic and have no bearing on gameplay, should be tested to make sure they load in properly.
