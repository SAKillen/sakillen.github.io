# Game Critique - Sunset Overdrive
- Developed by: Insomniac Games
- Released: October 28, 2014
- Platforms: Xbox One, Microsoft Windows
## Summary
Suset Overdrive is an action-adventure third-person shooter with a focus on player mobility. The player can quickly traverse the game's apocalyptic cityscape by grinding on and bouncing off of the scenery. The player has constant weapon-wheel access to eight weapons out of a larger arsenal. Enemies that are present in large numbers and can kill the player in just a few hits. To survive, the player must stay mobile as they use their weapons to kill enemies. Doing so will begin and maintain a combo counter, which fills a "style" meter. The meter has four fill thresholds, each of which activates different equippable abilities known as Overdrives.
## Features to Test
- Traversal system: The player must be able to jump, dodge roll, grind on railings and cables (and, in the case of cables, switch between grind on top and grinding while hanging underneath), jump off walls, run along walls, dash while grinding, dash in midair, dash across water, bounce on scenery, and jump to bounce higher after a melee ground slam attack. All actions can be transitioned to and from one another, all with the player's momentum intact.
- Weapon selection: The player must be able to instantly select any of eight weapons from the weapon wheel, and assign weapons to slots from the pause menu. Time must slow down for a limited period while the weapon wheel is active, and return to normal when inactive.
- Enemy tactics: In addition to relentlessly attacking the player, enemies must advance and try to intercept the player in their attacks and movements, even while the player is mobile.
- Style combo: All traversal and weapon actions must add to the style combo. These actions add to the style meter. The style meter progress must decay with unvarying or stagnated player input.
- Overdrive activation: Overdrives must activate automatically when the style meter progress reaches the relevant of the four levels on the meter. Overdrives must deactivate if the meter progress decays to below the relevant level.
