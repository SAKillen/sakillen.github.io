## Summary
Sundered is a metroidvania centered around Lovecraftian horror. The player controls Eshe, a woman granted powers by an ancient being known as the Trapezohedron. The Trapezohedron beseeches Eshe to explore the ruins of the Eschaton, a long-dead subterranean civilization that fell to invaders known as the Valkyries. The player must explore the Eschaton, fighting hordes of monsters and machines to further Eshe's abilities. New abilities can be found throughout the world and upgraded with Elder Shards that drop from defeated enemies. The game employs procedural generation, shuffling the paths to key rooms when the player dies (though the key rooms' locations remain fixed).
## Final Thoughts
As far as metroidvanias go, Sundered is fairly basic, with a few fatal flaws. The procedural generation, coupled with the lack of any real fast travel, makes simply navigating the game world laborious. And though Eshe handles very well in combat, the game has a nasty habit of inundating the player with dozens of enemies in enclosed spaces, making cheap, frequent deaths an inevitability for even the most seasoned player. The game is competently built, but poor design decisions take away from what could have been a great purist experience.
