## Summary
Quake II is a first-person shooter, and one of the first fully 3D games ever made. The player navigates appreciably complex levels, and must make it to the end of each level while eliminating enemy resistance. Though the player only starts with a basic weapon, many more are placed throughout the levels for the player to acquire. The singleplayer story is simple enough to drive the game's events forward: the player is a space marine who is sent to the homeworld of a hostile alien race in order to prevent an invasion of Earth. Several multiplayer modes are available, including free-for-all deathmatch, capture-the-flag, 1v1, and a cooperative version of the singleplayer mode.
## Final Thoughts
One thing I love about Quake II is its speed. The overwhelming trend with modern first-person shooters is to slow down player movement in favor of more cerebral, act-fast-or-die gunfights. Quake II, however, has both fast player movement and fast-action gunplay, which come together to make it one of the most exhilirating shooters ever made, even to this day. Also uncommon in modern shooters is the degree of verticality present in the level design, and the game is indeed wise enough to put this extra dimension to good use. My grievances with the game are related to it being more than twenty years old. In its default configuration, the game does not support widescreen resolution, and dark areas are nauseatingly dim. Also, despite exploring the available options, I didn't have the chance to play the multiplayer component. A twenty-year-old game is unlikely to have a high volume of concurrent players, but even then, Quake II doesn't ship with matchmaking. One counter to this, and another positive aspect of the game made possible by the official release of the source code, is the presence of mods that add content, including but not limited to matchmaking. Hence, if the game in its original incarnation does leave you wanting, you can literally make your own fun.
