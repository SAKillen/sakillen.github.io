## Summary
Volume is a stealth game that tells the story of Robin Hood in a dystopian future. The player controls Robert Locksley, a thief who comes into posession of a training simulator known as Volume. Volume is managed by an artificial intelligence called Alan, which instructs Locksley how to use the device. It is shortly revealed that Volume's scenarios are based on documented theivery against high-ranking members of society, and Locksley has been broadcasting these heists to the Internet, inspiring copycat criminals to steal from the rich in true Robin Hood fashion. This draws armed response from Guy Gisborne, the CEO of Volume's manufacturer, and now Locksley must confront him.

The game has a low-poly aesthetic presented from a top-down perspective. The player's goal is to guide Locksley to the end of the level without being spotted by the enemy. In addition to basic movement, the game has systems for cover and distraction. Sticking to cover allows Locksley to remain hidden while rounding corners and duck down along lower walls. In addition to interacting with objects in the level, Locksley can also distract enemies by whistling and using various gadgets. In addition to a solid one hundred story levels, Volume also has a level editor, allowing users to build and publish levels that can be played by other players worldwide.

## Final Thoughts
As a big fan of stealth games, my intial disposition towards the game was very scrutinous. However, Volume managed to well exceed my expectations. The stealth mechanics are solid and unmistakeably the star of the show. Though the player has plenty of options for how to get past the enemy, the enemy cannot actually be harmed, making it impossible to simply kill one's way to victory. And with one hundred levels included, plus a level editor and the opportunity to play levels from other players, there is a surplus of content. The biggest complaint I have about the game is with the initial presentation of the gadgets, in that it isn't immediately obvious that gadgets must be aimed to be used. Aside from that, however, the game is very well worth one's time.
