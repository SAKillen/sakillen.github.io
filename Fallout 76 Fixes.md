# 5 Bugs in Fallout 76...and How to Fix Them
## Fallout 76 crashes on PC with the error message "Fallout 76 has stopped working"
This is black box compatibility testing. Black box, because it is infeasible for Bethesda to know and test every possible hardware configuration that users will have, and compatibility, because this PC-centric bug is alluded to on Bethesda's own support site as being the result of differing hardware and software configurations. The solution to this problem is further internal testing on machines with both different hardware and different system software, and even different versions of said software.
## "No Access Granted" error when trying to lauch Fallout 76
This is black box smoke testing. Black box, because this error is a post-release problem, seemingly stemming from a difference between beta and retail activation keys, and smoke, because the process by which the problem is encountered is a simple login attempt. The solution to this problem is to do quick, automated login attempts for accounts with retail keys on machines that previously had/currently have the game's beta installed.
## Lever-Action Rifle does not properly reload ammunition
This is white box functional testing. White box, because Bethesda has direct access to the game's code and can more directly determine and fix the problem, and functional, because reloading is a core functionality of weapons. The solution to this problem is to debug the rifle in the development environment.
## Player models may appear invisible or partially invisible
This is white box functional testing. White box, because Bethesda has direct access to the game's code and can more directly determine and fix the problem, and functional, because invisibility makes it impossible to ascertain the location of affected players, which is potentially catastrophic for hostile player encounters. The solution to this problem is to debug the player models in the development environment.
## Assaultrons can occasionally fire infinite head beams
This is white box functional testing. White box, because Bethesda has direct access to the game's code and can more directly determine and fix the problem, and functional, because Assaultrons are (presumably) not intended to fire infinite head beams, and are therefore not functioning correctly. The solution to this problem is to debug the Assaultron attack functionality in the development environment.
